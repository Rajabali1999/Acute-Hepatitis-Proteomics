# Research Highlights
1.Label-free proteomics identified key pathways and proteins in non-HepA-E hepatitis.
2.Gremlin-1 and immune-related proteins may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.
3.Viral proteins indicate a possible post-infectious or immune-mediated disease, guiding targeted therapy development.


# Material & Methods
1.Experimental Design & Samples: Clinical case study on non-HepA-E hepatitis using plasma from two female children (13-month-old patient and 16-month-old control).
2.Sample Preparation: Albumin and IgG were removed; protein quantified by BCA assay. Samples were reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C.
3.Proteomic Analysis: Peptides separated by UPLC and analyzed on SYNAPT XS MS/MS using multidimensional fractionation and UDMSE acquisition.
4.Data Analysis: Proteins identified with Progenesis QI and UniProt (>99% confidence). Perseus used for statistical filtering.
5. Statistical & Functional Analysis: Heat maps, volcano plots, and Pearson correlation for differential expression; protein-protein interaction analysis used to explore disease mechanisms.
